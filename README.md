# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates my exceptional knowledge with NFT Creation and Deployment.
The steps are as follows: 
1. Upload your Image on PINATA and get the CID of the image.
2. UNderstand the flow of using opensea, especially the metadata file and readjust the document /json file.
3. Create your token using OPENZEPPELIN Standard.
4. Create the typescript files to deploy and interact with your NFR
5. While deploying ensure you deploy correctly using the network standard.

Necessarily that's all you need.

Thank you.
